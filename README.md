It imports necessary Node.js modules: fs (File System), http (HTTP server), and url (URL parsing).

There are three functions defined (readCarFile, writeCarFile, and deleteCarFile) for performing file operations like reading, writing, and deleting files.
An array sampleCars is defined, containing sample car data.

An HTTP server is created using http.createServer. It listens for incoming requests and handles them based on the request method (GET, POST, DELETE) and the requested pathname.

When a GET request is made to the root URL ("/"), it serves an HTML page with a welcome message and a form to view the sample car data.

When a GET request is made to "/api/v1/cars", it responds with the sampleCars array as JSON data.

There's a conditional block for handling POST and DELETE requests to "/api/v1/cars," although the actual code for handling these requests is not shown and is expected to be implemented elsewhere.

If the requested URL doesn't match any of the defined routes, it responds with a "Not Found" message and a status code of 404.

The server is set to listen on a port defined by the PORT variable, which defaults to 3001 if no port is specified in the environment variables. 

A message is logged to the console to indicate that the server is running.
